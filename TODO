	- Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) + drop + patterns
	- &str - slices, reread


Tips:
	- immutable by default
	- associated function = static
	- https://crates.io/ - for packages

	Ownership:
		1. Each value in Rust has a variable and it's called its owner.
		2. There can only be one owner at a time.
		3. If owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.
