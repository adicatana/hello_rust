“It’s a dangerous business, Frodo, going out
your door…You step into the Road, and if you don’t
 keep your feet, there is no knowing where you might
 be swept off to.”

“‘Why was I chosen?’ ‘Such questions cannot be answered,’
said Gandalf. ‘You may be sure that it was not for any
merit that others do not possess: not for power or
wisdom, at any rate. But you have been chosen, and you
must therefore use such strength and heart and wits as you have.’”
